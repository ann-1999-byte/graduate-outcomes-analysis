# Exploring Graduate Outcomes in Higher Education (UK)

This project analyzes graduate outcome data from UK higher education institutions using both supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques. It explores how variables like field of study, qualification level, and provider type influence post-education paths.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To uncover patterns in graduate outcomes using machine learning and provide insights into factors influencing further study, employment, and academic trajectories in the UK education system.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Techniques

- **Python**: pandas, sklearn, matplotlib
- **Models**: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, K-means Clustering
- **Evaluation**: Accuracy, AUC-ROC, Elbow Method for clustering

---

## 📈 Key Findings

- Random Forest outperformed Gradient Boosting with ~45% accuracy.
- K-means clustering revealed 4 distinct graduate outcome groups.
- Subject area and provider type were key predictors.
- ROC analysis showed strong discrimination for several classes.
